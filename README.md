# Debris-Dispersion

Takes an OpenRocket simulation as input and allows for the simulation of debris trajectories for risk assesment.

This is a work in progress, the results have not yet been tested and there are many bugs to be found. Plus, not all features have been implemented yet.

Feel free to contact me at anytime for further questions.
